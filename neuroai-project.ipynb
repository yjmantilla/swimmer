Elegans motor circuit, for the control of a simulated Swimmer agent. Traditional motor control ANNs often rely on generic, fully connected multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), which demand extensive training data, offer limited transferability, and possess complex internal dynamics that challenge interpretability. The project aims to understand how the biologically motivated ANN, which is shaped by evolution to be highly structured and sparse, could help to solve these problems and provide advantages in the domain of motor control. We will train MLPs using algorithms such as PPO, DDPG, and ES, and compare their performance in terms of rewards and sample efficiency with our bio-inspired ANN. The project also includes visualizing the C. Elegans connectome and building the network using this circuitry. We will conduct various ablation analyses by removing sign and weight-sharing constraints, and altering environmental parameters like the swimmer’s length or viscosity. These investigations aim to understand how architecture and modularity impact performance and learning across different environments. Finally, the project aims at building an agent that is robust to environmental variations, navigating towards specific targets, and enhancing our understanding of bio-inspired motor control.  \n","\n","\n","**Relevant references:**  \n","\n","- [Neural circuit architectural priors for embodied control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05242)  \n","- [Hierarchical motor control in mammals and machines](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-13239-6)  \n","- [Continuous control with deep reinforcement learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.02971.pdf)  \n","\n","*This notebook uses code from the following GitHub repository:* [ncap](https://github.com/nikhilxb/ncap) by Nikhil X.

Within this project, there are multiple pathways you can explore. For each pathway, you will delve deeply into one of the main sections outlined in this notebook, allowing for a thorough investigation of different factors that can influence performance:\n","\n","*   ***Exploring the effects of environment:*** Investigate how different environmental settings impact agent performance. This could involve altering parameters of the environment or the types of tasks and reward functions. Understanding these effects can help in making better architectural choices and learning algorithms that result in agents that are robust and adaptable\n","\n","\n","*   ***Exploring the effects of learning algorithms:*** Standard RL algorithms often struggle with sparse and constrained networks, which can lead to suboptimal performance. Explore where these algorithms fail and analyze potential reasons for their limitations. Experiment with modifications or alternative algorithms that might overcome these challenges.\n","\n","\n","* ***Exploring the effects of model architecture:*** Investigate how various architectural decisions within the NCAP model influence its performance. Visualize the model and its activity and explore potential improvements by tweaking architectural elements, assessing how these changes affect learning outcomes and operational efficiency."]}],"metadata":{"accelerator":"GPU","colab":{"collapsed_sections":[],"gpuType":"T4","include_colab_link":true,"name":"Macrocircuits","provenance":[],"toc_visible":true},"kaggle":{"accelerator":"none","dataSources":[],"dockerImageVersionId":30746,"isGpuEnabled":false,"isInternetEnabled":true,"language":"python","sourceType":"notebook"},"kernel":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.13"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
